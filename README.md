#Pliable CSS

It's a responsive layout structure (HTML/CSS) for a page that just needs a header at the top, content centered, and footer at the bottom.  Pliable is meant to be used when you want to keep things simple.  But can also work well hand in hand with heavy libraries like Bootstrap.  

##Getting Started

###1) Link to Pliable

Your HTML file, index.html, needs to link to the /pliable/pliable.css.  

```
<link href="css/pliable/pliable.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
We assume that you use a /css folder in your project.  If so, download the /pliable folder into your /css folder.  The file structure should look like this:

```
your-project/css/pliable/
```
Now you are set to write your HTML.

###2) HTML Tags
